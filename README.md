India is the world's largest producer of Pulses, Rice, wheat and Spice products, still, there is no interface to sell farmers products directly. The farmers' welfare depends on better market value to their products but they struggle to get it. Because the mediator collects agricultural products from farmers and makes a profit out of them and farmers are getting only 20% of consumer price. To overcome the above bottlenecks, in this project, we developed a portal to sell the products which significantly increase farmer’s income. The app consists of two sections (i) Farmers can directly market their products to the consumers by eliminating the mediators, (ii) The final phase is the Time Series Forecasting model to suggest the product price range using historical data. The FbProphet technique is used to forecast their commodity price. And this model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to prevent the loss. Subsequently, the farmer can trace the days’ worth, with the help of a visualization method that represents the entire data, including item, price of the day in graphical visualization. Thus our project mainly aims to provide the farmer's income to the maximum level and decreases the actual selling price due to the elimination of agents.
